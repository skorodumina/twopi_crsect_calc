These scripts are used to process the outputs of the double-pion analysis program, which is stored at https://github.com/skorodumina/two\_pi\_analysis\_code.git

Simulation files that correspond to the final program version are stored at

/mss/clas/e1e/production/simulation_2pi/sim_skorodum_Aug2016/aft_2pi_mymain_test1Jul2021_sig2/fin_root1jul2021test_*
/mss/clas/e1e/production/simulation_2pi/sim_skorodum_Aug2016/aft_2pi_mymain_test1Jul2021_evt/fin_root1jul2021test_evt_*

(1325 files in each directory)


==========SIMULATION==============

The folowing scripts directly use the outputs of the double-pion analysis program. They convert 1325 of those files into 53.   

first_2top_gen_rec_add.C, 
second_2top_sig2_gen_rec_add.C,
third_2top_evt_gen_rec_add.C 

They work with the histograms filled with sigma, sigma*sigma, and one, respectively.
To run them in sequence the corresponding *.sh scripts should be used (i.e., first_2top_gen_rec_add.sh 1325).

The 53 outputs of these scripts are then subject to hadd to form the combined files.

The following scripts work with the aforementioned combined files:

top_combine_sim_eff.C
top_combine_sim_sig2.C
top_combine_sim_evt.C

They are used for either the efficiency calculation and/or topologies combination.


===============DATA================

For the experimental data the following script uses as inputs two files (for the full and empty target runs), both the outputs of the double-pion analysis program.

top_combine_data.C

The script combines topologies and applies FSI correction.
