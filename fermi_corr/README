This folder stores the scripts needed to calculate the Fermi correction factor.

For this purpose the two sets of files are used. 

The first set is generated with the TWOPEG event generator (off the proton at rest). 
These files (10000) are stored at /cache/mss/clas/e1e/production/simulation_2pi/sim_skorodum_Aug2016/fermicorr/nofermi_norad_conv/

The second set is generated with the TWOPEG-D event generator (off the moving proton). 
These files (10000) are stored at /cache/mss/clas/e1e/production/simulation_2pi/sim_skorodum_Aug2016/fermicorr/fermi_norad_conv/

Both two sets should be processed with the Fermi correction program. It is located in the corresponding folder. The path to the corresponding file-set should be changed manually in script_xsect_calc.cxx

The program should be run on farms.The submission scripts are located at the directory jsub/
The output consists of 2000 files for each set.

These 2000 files are then subject to combining using hadd. The corresponding scripts are located at jsub/ferm_norad/ and jsub/noferm_norad/ for each of two sets.

Once combined, the two resulting files should be proccesed with the script corr_fact_calc.C to calculate the Fermi correction factor.
