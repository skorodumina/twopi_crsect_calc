The script cr_sec_combined_small_bin.C is used for the cross section calculation. 

It uses as inputs:

- the data_file that is produced after the histogram-proccessing scripts (see the folder ../hist_proc_scripts/ and the README there).

- the sim_file that is produced after the histogram-proccessing scripts (see the folder ../hist_proc_scripts/ and the README there).

- the fermi_correction_file that is produced after the Fermi corection program (see the folder ../fermi_corr/ and the README there).

- the auxiliary file with model proton-at-rest cross sections. This file is located at /mss/home/skorodum/e1e/empty_cells_new_bin.root


The script calculates the single-differeential and integral cross sections and outputs them in the root file.

The cross sections then should be subject to the binning corrections and systematic errors study.

This version of the script calculates the final verson of the cross sections.
